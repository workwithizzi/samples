## Lists
[Lists.design](https://lists.design/) is a gallery of real content ready to populate your mockups, built by designers who want to work more efficiently. All this data is organised by lists. Each list gathers a number of entities of the same type of content. We have purposefully made the format of lists simple : text files. With a line break separating each entity.

Example: `teamsnba.txt`
```html
Atlanta Hawks
Boston Celtics
Brooklyn Nets
Charlotte Hornets
Chicago Bulls
Cleveland Cavaliers
Dallas Mavericks
Denver Nuggets
Detroit Pistons
Golden State Warriors
...
```

## Contribute
With your help, Lists will ultimately gather all the data types designers could ever need.  Join us on our adventurous journey.

### Create a list

- Add your new list by creating another .txt file.
- Push to your fork and submit a pull request. Make sure to explain what's new.

### Naming convention
Any list can be language specific, or country specific. Our naming convention uses language and/or country codes to deal with these intricacies. Below are a few examples explaining how we name lists.

```html
985
756
507
964
309
...
```
`numbers100to999.txt` is language and country agnostic, no language/country code.

```html
Paleo Pumpkin Bread
Double Broccoli Quinoa
Deep Dish Fruit Pizza
Baked Chicken and Spinach Flautas
Homemade Strawberry Lemonade
...
```
`recipes-en.txt` is a list in english, so we use the `-en` suffix.

```html
972 Sylvan Street South Angelina, NL S0B2V9
11907 Doyle Cape Cydneyview, MB H5B 2V2
8832 Adah Vista South Guido, PE B2P-1J8
52906 Danyka Freeway Port Michaelborough, NU N7L8L2
89913 Gottlieb Forks Suite 588 Schadenport, YT A0A-0H9
...
```
`address-en_CA.txt` is a list in english, and it's specific to Canada, so we use the `-en_CA` suffix.

This system is pretty straightforward. Go ahead and [browse](https://github.com/listsfordesign/Lists/tree/master/Lists "browse") through the lists to get familiar with our naming convention.
