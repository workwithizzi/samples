# HTML5 Test Page

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/html5-test-page.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/html5-test-page)

This is a test page filled with common HTML elements to be used to provide visual feedback whilst building CSS systems and frameworks.

I have not been able to find a dead-simple, standalone test page out there, so I made one. The HTML elements are loosely categorized as either text, embedded content, or form elements.

## Versioning

HTML5 Test Page will be maintained using the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines. From here on out, releases will be numbered using the following format:

`major.minor.patch`

* Breaking backwards compatibility increments `major`, while resetting `minor` and `patch`.
* New code that does not break backwards compatibility increments `minor`, while resetting `patch`.
* Bug fixes and other small changes increment `patch`.
